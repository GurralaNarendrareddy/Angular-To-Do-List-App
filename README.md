This is an angular to do list application where users can add new task to their to do list and can able to update existing task and also delete the task.
In src folder i have created component folder where my components present.
In server file i had written the backend code for create,read,update and delete task.I have used tech stacks like Node.js,Express.js and Mysql for storing data.
